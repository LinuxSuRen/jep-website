<p>The JEP outlines the criteria to be used for determining which plugins are
included in the Jenkins 2.0 Setup dialog&#8217;s list of plugins
and which subset of those will be "Suggested Plugins" to be installed by default.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_specification">Specification</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plugins qualify for inclusion in the list based on a number of criteria:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_selection_criteria">Selection Criteria</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plugin popularity (both in absolute numbers and growth rate), which can serve
as a stand-in for plugin usefulness unless we believe this to be inaccurate
for specific reasons (e.g. CVS Plugin and Monitor External Job being installed a lot, but only because they were bundled).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the plugin integrate well with Jenkins? Does it work e.g. with concurrent builds, in secured Jenkins, and distributed Jenkins (master + agent setup)? People new to Jenkins should not be surprised by a plugin offered here undermining or not working with these features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the plugin more than just superficial themeing/UI? While those have their place and are popular, advertising plugins changing the UI out of the box would be very weird (Simple Theme Plugin, Green Balls)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the features it provides useful to someone fairly new to Jenkins? If the plugin requires someone to e.g. be familiar with Jenkins internals before they can use it successfully, or to have multiple Jenkins instances, it may not be a good choice for this dialog. For example, if the script console were a plugin, it would probably not be on here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if it&#8217;s not popular, is it a reasonably common SCM? SCMs are so fundamental to successful Jenkins use that these shouldn&#8217;t be as heavily restricted as some of the other categories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plugin most work without requiring a restart of Jenkins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plugin must be discoverable when installed, and at least allow users to get started without outside documentation. (This disqualifies Build Token Root Plugin.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plugin is hosted in the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci">jenkinsci</a> GitHub organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plugin must be maintained reasonably well (e.g. was updated in the last 18 months or so, and ideally has a dedicated maintainer).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_categories">Categories</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given the diverse feature set of Jenkins plugins, it is difficult to define a
set of categories that can be used to group plugins without misrepresenting
them (and having every plugin only show up once in the list, rather than
multiple times). The following categories appear to adequately provide a
high-level view of plugin functionality in Jenkins:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>General</strong>: Anything that has no better category. Depending on contents, these may result in the creation of new categories. Possible examples are Rebuilder Plugin, or Translation Assistance Plugin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Organization and Administration</strong>: Plugins that help Jenkins administrators accomplish their goals, and that help keep order. Examples are Monitoring Plugin, Antisamy Markup Formatter, or Disk Usage Plugin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build Features</strong> are plugins that provide features to builds/jobs typically beyond an SCM, build step or publisher. SSH Agent Plugin, AnsiColor Plugin, and Timestamper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build Tools</strong>: for plugins providing build tool integration, e.g. NodeJS Plugin, Maven Plugin, Gradle Plugin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build Analysis and Reporting</strong>: Plugins in this category process reports or data generated during builds, such as JUnit Plugin, Build Failure Analyzer, or Checkstyle Plugin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build Pipelines and Continuous Delivery</strong>: is for plugins that allow creating more complex chains of actions that would reasonably be possible in a single freestyle job. Examples are Copy Artifact Plugin, Parameterized Trigger Plugin, or Workflow Plugin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SCM</strong>:provides a selection of plugins that integrate with SCM tools, e.g. Subversion Plugin, GitHub Plugin, or GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distributed Builds and Containers</strong>: are plugins that provide different build environments to builds, such as Docker Plugin, Windows Slaves Plugin, or Matrix Project Plugin.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currently no container plugins made the cut (e.g. <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-plugin">Docker plugin</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Management and Security</strong>: contains all plugins related to securing Jenkins, such as Matrix Authorization Plugin, LDAP Plugin, or Secure Requester Whitelist Plugin.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some overlap with Organization and Administration, e.g. Antisamy Markup Formatter. The difference is that these plugins are mostly useless when security is disabled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notifications and Publishing</strong>: are plugins that notify other systems about builds and build results, or publish data, typically on remote systems. Examples are JIRA Plugin, Mailer Plugin, Email Extension Plugin, or Slack Plugin.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Likely overlap with Build Analysis and Reporting. The difference is mostly that plugins in this category typically require specific other systems or software to work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Languages</strong>: are plugins that provide localization for Jenkins and others plugins. The specific language plugin will be selected according to the user-agent settings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any of these categories will be present as necessary for the plugin selection.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_motivation">Motivation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jenkins 2.0 will include a setup dialog that pops up when Jenkins starts for
the first time. It intends to help people new to Jenkins to get started
quickly, and present them with a reasonably sized set of plugins to choose from
for customizing their instance, of they so choose. To this end, not every
plugin will be presented here. While the extensibility of Jenkins is one of its
strengths, exposing new users to the 1200+ available plugins before they&#8217;ve
even started using Jenkins isn&#8217;t a reasonable approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need to establish criteria for which plugins are shown,
which plugins are "suggested" (installed by default),
and who these list will be changed over time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_reasoning">Reasoning</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While it is a much desired feature to have an initial setup experience that
includes the ability to choose plugins, it&#8217;s better not to overwhelm
inexperienced users by exposing them to the full list of plugins from the
start.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Forcing those with no experience to choose between 1000+ plugins before they
can even start using Jenkins is an impossible task. They may not even be fully
aware what plugins are for, and that Jenkins doesn&#8217;t really do much without any
of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A selection of known good plugins is a much better choice for this particular
setup dialog, and that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s currently implemented. The initial selection
of 'curated' (= available for selection) plugins was provided to Gus and Tom by
<a href="https://github.com/daniel-beck">Daniel Beck</a> (and tweaked by them after
some early reviewer feedback). Daniel used the stats data
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>
as a starting point and then tried to define useful categories for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The plugins to be selected for installation by default are a subset of the
curated list. For the SCMs, Daniel used the 2014 Eclipse survey
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>
determine what&#8217;s popular. Otherwise Daniel selected a list of what he
considered most universally useful, things that have people wondering why
they&#8217;re not core features.</p>
