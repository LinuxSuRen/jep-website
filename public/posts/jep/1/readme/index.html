<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Jenkins Enhancement Proposal (JEP) is a design document that
describes a new feature or aspect of Jenkins itself,
or the Jenkins project processes or environment.
This JEP describes the structure of JEP documents
and details the process by which JEPs are
created, submitted, reviewed, finalized, and maintained.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_a_jep">What is a JEP?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JEP stands for Jenkins Enhancement Proposal.
A JEP is a design document that
describes a new feature or aspect of Jenkins itself, or Jenkins project, plugin, processes or environment.
A JEP provides a concise technical specification of the feature,
describes the motivation for the change,
and discusses the rationale behind the design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JEPs are the primary mechanism for proposing major new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into Jenkins.
Each JEP must have at least one <a href="#_sponsor">Sponsor</a>.
The JEP Sponsor is responsible for the JEP overall - building
consensus for that JEP within the community, documenting dissenting opinions,
coordinating contributors work, and generally ensuring the JEP
meets the style, format, and quality guidelines described below.
A JEP may also have any number of <a href="#_contributor">Contributors</a> who
help write, implement, discussion, or offer feedback about the JEP.
One contributor might do only one or any combination
of these things during any part of the life of a JEP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the JEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_repo">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>

<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For non-text files added to the repository, such as images, the files must be
readable with free and open source tools, and should ideally be editable by
other contributors. For example, use SVG rather than PSD for vector graphics.</p>

<h3 id="_jep_types">JEP Types</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three kinds of JEP:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A <strong>Standards Track</strong> JEP describes a new feature or implementation
for Jenkins. It may also describe an interoperability or
backwards-compatibility standard which will be supported for the feature in
current versions of Jenkins, moving forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <strong>Informational</strong> JEP describes a Jenkins design issue, or
provides general guidelines or information to the Jenkins community,
but does not propose a new feature. Informational JEPs do not
necessarily represent a Jenkins community consensus or
recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore
Informational JEPs or follow their advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Process</strong> JEP describes a process surrounding Jenkins, or
proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process JEPs are like
Standards Track JEPs but apply to areas other than the Jenkins codebase
itself. They may propose an implementation, but not for what would be
generally considered the Jenkins codebase; they often require community
consensus; unlike Informational JEPs, they are more than recommendations, and
users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures,
guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools
or environment used in Jenkins development. Any meta-JEP (JEP focusing on the
improvement of the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal process) is also considered a
Process JEP.</p>

<h4 id="_bdfl">BDFL</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several references in this JEP to the "BDFL". This acronym stands for
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">Benevolent Dictator for Life</a>".
The BDFL is a single person whose role in the project is to act as decision maker
when a unilateral decision is needed. The responsibilities of the BDFL are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Review JEPs and decide whether they will be accepted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolve disputes or arguments within the JEP process that cannot be resolved by consensus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delegate their responsibilities to other contributors as neeeded on a per-JEP basis (see <a href="#_bdfl_delegate">BDFL Delegate</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take any other actions as part of the JEP process that they deem best for the Jenkins project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearly communicate the reasoning for any actions taken or decisions made</p>

<h4 id="_editor">Editor</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JEP editors are individuals responsible for managing the administrative
and editorial aspects of the JEP workflow (e.g. assigning JEP numbers and
changing their status). See <a href="#editor-responsibilities">JEP Editor Responsibilities &amp; Workflow</a> for

<h4 id="_contributor">Contributor</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A JEP may have any number of "Contributors" who
help write, implement, discuss, or offer feedback about that JEP.
One contributor might do only one or any combination of these
of these things during any part of the life of a JEP.
While we invite contributions by companies or other organizations, contributors listed in a JEP
(such as Sponsors or BDFL Delegates below) need to be specific people.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_sponsor">Sponsor</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each JEP has at least one "Sponsor".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JEP Sponsor is a contributor who is responsible for the JEP throughout its lifecycle.
Their responsibilities include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Building consensus for that JEP within the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documenting dissenting opinions</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Setting and communicating the schedule as needed</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Sponsor of a JEP may or may not do any of the tasks other contributors do.
For example, one sponsor might write large portions of one JEP,
while another sponsor might leave the writing to other contributors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyone may be Sponsor for a JEP,
though it should be someone familiar enough with Jenkins, the Jenkins project,
and the JEP workflow to effectively guide the JEP to completion.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A JEP may have more than one Sponsor, especially after it has been finalized
and is being maintained over time.
For simplicity, this document uses the singular
("The JEP Sponsor", "a sponsor")
when referring the one or more people in the role of "Sponsor" of a JEP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sponsors have committer/write access on the JEP repository, but should
only approve and merge pull requests for JEPs to which they are assigned.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_bdfl_delegate">BDFL Delegate</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="#_bdfl">BDFL</a> may delegate their responsibilities to another contributor,
a "BDFL Delegate" on a per-JEP basis.
The BDFL Delegate for a JEP has all the responsibilities of the BDFL within the context of that JEP,
except that BDFL Delegate may not delegate to someone else - there is no such thing as a "BDFL Delegate Delegate".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A BDFL Delegate may be selected at any point before the JEP is reviewed.
A record of this selection must be available publicly.
Any contributor with sufficient technical and organizational
experience to make the final decision on that JEP,
may offer to be the BDFL&#8217;s Delegate for a JEP.
If their self-nomination is accepted by the other core contributors and the BDFL,
then that contributor will have the authority to accept (or reject) that JEP.
The BDFL Delegate for a JEP will be recorded in the
<a href="#header-delegate">"BDFL-Delegate" header</a> in the JEP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A JEP&#8217;s <a href="#_sponsor">Sponsor</a> may also be the BDFL Delegate for that JEP,
taking on the responsibilities of both roles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a Delegate wishes to leave a JEP, they may do so at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com">jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com</a>.
They can also be removed from a JEP by the BDFL.
When a BDFL Delegate leaves or is removed from a JEP,
the BDFL becomes the reviewer again and may ask someone else to be the BDFL Delegate for that JEP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BDFL Delegates have committer/write access on the JEP repository, but should
only approve and merge pull requests for JEPs to which they are assigned.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#submission">Submission</a></strong> - Andrea writes up the proposal using the JEP document template as a guide.
She includes supporting documentation
and a minimal prototype implementation sufficient to convey the viability of the design.
She submits the JEP to the <a href="#editor">JEP editors</a> for
<a href="#approval">approval as a Draft JEP</a>.
One of the editors checks the submission and determines it is ready to considered as a JEP.
They "approve" the submission, assigning the JEP a number,
and the submission becomes a "<a href="#draft">Draft</a>" JEP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="#draft">Draft Status</a></strong> - While the JEP is a "<a href="#draft">Draft</a>", Andrea continues to gather
feedback, change the proposal, and record the reasoning and differing views.
At the same time, she and other contributors continue expanding and refining
the prototype implementation as needed to match the current state of the JEP.
When Andrea believes the JEP is stable,
addresses all major design and scope questions,
and represents the consensus of the community,
she then asks the <a href="#_reviewer">Reviewer</a>, in this case the <a href="#_bdfl_delegate">BDFL Delegate</a> Kelly,
to review the JEP for Acceptance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="#review">Review</a></strong> - Kelly reviews the JEP
and any related discussions and implementation.
Kelly agrees with Andrea that consensus has been reached regarding the JEP
and that the implementation is far enough along to enusure that
the design is stable and complete.
Kelly marks the JEP as an "<a href="#accepted">Accepted</a>" JEP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="#accepted">Accepted Status</a></strong> - Andrea and other contributors
complete all remaining implementation related to the
"<a href="#accepted">Accepted</a>" JEP (code, documentation, or other changes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="#final">Final Status</a></strong> - When the implementation is complete
and all changes have been published
or otherwise incorporated into the appropriate code repositories,
the JEP status is changed to "<a href="#final">Final</a>"
(or in some cases "<a href="#active">Active</a>").
The JEP is done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="#maintenance">Maintenance</a></strong> - At some later date,
the JEP may need to be updated with minor changes and clarifications.
As <a href="#_sponsor">Sponsor</a> of the JEP, Andrea makes changes as needed or hands off sponsorship to someone else.
Updates follow the same basic JEP workflow.
For extensive changes or additions,
Andrea will start a whole new JEP instead of updating the original JEP.
This new JEP might expand on the orginal or might <a href="#replaced">replace</a> it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#_other_jep_outcomes">Other Outcomes</a></strong> - Not all JEPs will be accepted and finalized.

<p>The JEP process begins with a new idea for Jenkins.
A single JEP should contain a single key proposal or new idea.
The more focused the JEP, the more successful it tends to be.
The JEP editors reserve the right to reject potential JEPs

<p>Each JEP must have a "<a href="#_sponsor">Sponsor</a>"&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;someone who writes the JEP using the style and
format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums,
and attempts to build community consensus around the idea.
The JEP Sponsor should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is JEP-able.
Posting to the <a href="mailto:jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com">jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com</a> mailing list is the best way to
go about this.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="discussion">Discuss the idea with the community</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a JEP is meant
to save the potential sponsor time. Many ideas have been brought
forward for changing Jenkins that have been rejected for various
reasons. Asking the Jenkins community first if an idea is original
helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is
guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching
the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure
the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the sponsor. Just
because an idea sounds good to the sponsor does not mean it will work for most
people in most areas where Jenkins is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the sponsor has asked the Jenkins community whether an idea has any
chance of acceptance, a "pre-Draft" JEP should be presented to <a href="mailto:jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com">jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com</a>.
This gives the sponsor a chance to flesh out the JEP to make sure it is
properly formatted, of high quality, and to address initial concerns about the
proposal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even for "pre-Draft" discussion, sponsors may find it convient to follow the
<a href="#submission">JEP Submission</a> steps below, including creating a PR,
but state in PR comments that they not yet ready to submit the JEP.
This allows them to use the PR request tools for discussion and modification right away,
and sets them up for a smooth submission process.
In this case, the sponsor only needs to notify <code>@jenkinsci/jep-editors</code> when they are ready to
submit the JEP for <a href="#approval">approval as Draft</a>.</p>

<p>Standards Track JEPs consist of two parts, a design document

an email to the <a href="mailto:jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com">jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com</a> mailing list.
The JEP <a href="#_reviewer">Reviewer</a> and their chosen consultants then review the JEP.
If the Reviewer agrees that JEP is ready, they mark the JEP as "<a href="#Accepted">Accepted</a>".
If they do not agree, they leave the JEP as a "Draft", awaiting further revision.
In either case, the reviewer must send a detailed response

<p>By marking a JEP as "Accepted" the Reviewer indicates they believe that the JEP has

They must still pass the other criteria, such as scoping and design completeness.</p>

The Jenkins project values contribution over "talk"
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>, and as such the
implementation is of utmost importance to moving any proposal (Standards or
Process) forward.</p>

<p>Ideally, all changes to a JEP should be completed before it is "Accepted",

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All changes to an already "Accepted" JEP, must be submitted via PR as usual.
In the case of major changes,
the Sponsor should also communicate those changes on the mailing list

A link to any discussion should be added to the PR for the change
and to the <a href="#_required_sections">References</a> section.

during discussion.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backwards Compatibility</strong> - All JEPs must include a section describing
any incompatibilities and their severity.
The JEP must explain how it proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.
If there are no backwards compatibility concerns, the section must say that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong> - All JEPs must include a section describing their security impact.
This includes outlining what was done to identify and evaluate security issues,
discussion of potential security issues and how they are mitigated or prevented,
and how the JEP interacts with existing permissions, authentication, authorization, etc.
If the JEP has no impact on security, the section must say that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Requirements</strong> -
All JEPs must include a section describing their impact on
Jenkins project infrastructure,
including additions or changes, interactions with exiting components,
potential instabilities, service-level agreements,
and assigning responsibility for continuing maintenance.
Each JEP must explain the scope of infrastructure changes with sufficient detail
to allow initial and on-going cost (in both time and money) to be estimated.
If the JEP has no impact on infrastructure, the section must say that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Testing</strong> -
All JEPs which include code changes must include a section summarizing how the
changes will be tested. The JEP itself need not include a complete test
plan—this could be developed concurrently with the rest of the
implementation—but it should set out expectations for testability. If the JEP
has no testing needs, the section must say that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prototype Implementation</strong>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;If a JEP will include code changes,
this section will provide links to a an open source prototype implementation of those changes.
The prototype implementation must be present for a JEP to be approved as <a href="#draft">Refining a Draft JEP</a>.
The prototype implementation must be sufficient to convey the viability of the design
for a JEP to be <a href="#accepted">Accepting a JEP</a>.
While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the
specification and reasoning before writing code,
the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful
when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
JEPs which will not include code changes may omit this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>References</strong>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;When moving a JEP from a Draft to "Accepted" or "Final" state,
the references section must be updated to include links to the pull requests
and mailing list discussions which were involved in the process. The JEP
should self-document the process in which it was developed.</p>

<h3 id="_reporting_jep_bugs_or_submitting_jep_updates">Reporting JEP Bugs, or Submitting JEP Updates</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process for reporting a bug or submitting a JEP update depends on several factors,
such as the maturity of the JEP, the preferences of the JEP sponsor, and the nature
of the comments. For the early draft stages of the JEP, it&#8217;s probably best to
send  comments and changes directly to the JEP sponsor. For more mature, or
finished JEPs consider submitting corrections to the JEP repository
<sup class="footnoteref">[<a class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> or the Jenkins issue tracker
<sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_issues">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>.  If the JEP sponsor is a
Jenkins developer, assign the bug/patch to them, otherwise assign it to a JEP
editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When in doubt about where to send changes, please check first
with the JEP sponsor and/or a JEP editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even JEP sponsors with git push privileges for the JEP repository should submit
via Pull Request, with the exception of status or resolution updates
which may be pushed directly given the change was already discussed
and agreed to elsewhere.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="transferring">Transferring JEP Sponsorship</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer sponsorship of JEPs to a
new sponsor. In general, it is preferable to retain the original sponsor as
a co-sponsor of the transferred JEP, but that&#8217;s really up to the
original sponsor. A good reason to transfer sponsorship is because the
original sponsor no longer has the time or interest in updating it or
following through with the JEP process, or has fallen off the face of
the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad
reason to transfer sponsorship is because the sponsor doesn&#8217;t agree with the
direction of the JEP. One aim of the JEP process is to try to build
consensus around a JEP, but if that&#8217;s not possible, a sponsor can always
submit a competing JEP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ownership of a JEP may also be assumed via pull request.
Fork the JEP repository, <sup class="footnoteref">[<a class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> make the sponsorship
modification, and submit a pull request. At the same time, send a message asking
to take over, addressed to both the original sponsor and the JEP editors via
<a href="mailto:jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com">jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com</a>.  If the original sponsor doesn&#8217;t respond to email in a timely
manner, the JEP editors will make a unilateral decision (it&#8217;s not like such

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jenkins has classically been driven by "you-had-to-be-there" development. With
specific changes largely being driven by smaller independent groups of
developers (sometimes just one).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design documents extending back into the history of Jenkins are few and far
between, as the project grew organically over time. As such, a contributor,
existing or future, must read mountains of code, pull requests, mailing list
discussions, etc, in order to fully understand how/what/why for many major
subsystems within Jenkins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, Jenkins has no formal approach to discussing and reviewing larger
changes as evidenced by many of the Jenkins 2.0 mailing list threads
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup>,
which ballooned into threads with 100+ replies and sufficient chaos to be very
difficult for those who weren&#8217;t full-time Jenkins developers to understand.</p>
</div>

<p>The Jenkins Enhancement Proposal aims to address both of these major issues by

enhancements to Jenkins.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_benefits_to_existing_developers">Benefits to existing developers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JEP provides a systematic approach for vetting and developing new proposals and

<p>The Python community, whose process JEP is modeled after, have successfully
navigated several large-scale reworkings of Python and its related tools and
processes over the past decade. This includes most notably the multi-year
project of Python 3 (formerly Python 3000).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Their Python Enhancement Proposals are largely consensus driven, which is
<em>mostly</em> how work is done presently in the Jenkins project,

<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup>

<p>The process by which a number of <a href="https://apache.org">Apache</a> projects are
operated was also considered, but the Python Enhancement Proposal process was
by far the most well-documented and obviously successful approach considered to
project improvement (technical and otherwise) over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Python process uses "Rationale" as the heading for the section for describing design decisions.
However the meaning of "Rationale" is similar to "Motivation" in some contexts.
We decided to use "Reasoning" instead to avoid confusion.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_requirements_level_terms">Requirements-level terms</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some non-native english speakers commented on the
<a href="#requirement-levels">Must/Should/May</a> mentioned that "should" is a synonym of "must",
but that existing RFC was a good justification for keeping the terms.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_limits_of_bdfl_model">Limits of BDFL model</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People expressed concern over the limits of the current model where the BDFL
has final say in a number of steps.
They felt having 1-person bottlenecks in the JEP process could be problematic.
The BDFL delegating to others addresses some of that,
but it is still worth noting possible alternatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One alternative would be for the Jenkins project Governance meeting to have final say.
Another alternative would be to create some sort of "Technical Steering Committee",
separate from Governance, to do this job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Issues mentioned in relation to these alternatives:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Voting policy</strong> - a voting policy would need to be established,
outlining what percentage of the meeting would need to vote for or against a JEP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Committee vs Delegation</strong> - a strictly committee-approval approach
may not result in good decisions being made in a timely manner. For example,
only a few people are qualified to make decisions on Remoting.
It would be difficult for a group of people in <code>#jenkins-meeting</code> to vote
sensibly on a JEP relating to Remoting which most of them don&#8217;t fully understand.
Delegation to experts and stakeholders is much more likely to produce high quality improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of established process</strong> - structured technical decision making
in the Jenkins project (as outlined in this JEP) is still in its early stages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The BDFL model with Delegation as needed may not be sufficient in the long run,
but it will suffice for now.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_timeliness">Timeliness</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Along with concerns about a bottleneck in reviews,
some wanted to add specific language to set expectations timeliness
(also sometimes referred to a
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">service-level agreements</a>", or SLAs).
The "<a href="#Deferred">[Deferred]</a>" status addresses what happens if
a sponsor does not move a JEP forward in a timely manner,
but there are no contingencies for slow response from
contributors, editors, BDFL, or BDFL delegates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are any number of ways to set expectations about timeliness.
For example, regarding the review process, one person mentioned put forward,
<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/pull/1#discussion-diff-139636422R362">this possible outline</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For now, we have chosen to add a "<a href="#_scheduling_and_timeframes">Scheduling and timeframes</a>" section
and not to set specific timeframes for action or response.
Attempting to set exact limits on a volunteer organization could lead to more
difficulties than leaving the timing up to the contributors to each JEP.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_requiring_same_license">Requiring same license</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some contributors were concerned that changes to a component
"must be the same license as the component the proposal is
meant to added to (or MIT licensed by default)."
The mentioned that  some companies strictly require "Apache v.2",
because MIT is not explicit about the patent release.
By setting this condition we explicitly require contributors
to create at least a prototype implementation with the MIT license,
which their employer may not allow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could allow other licenses, or mixed licenses.
However, most JEPs will refer to core or many of the "essential" plugins.
All of those are MIT licensed, such that anybody contributing
to those repositories is already expected to contribute
under the existing (MIT) license.</p>

<h3 id="_asciidoc_style_and_linter">Asciidoc style and linter</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a number of possible asciidoc style guidelines.
For example, there are a number of reasons to use
<a href="http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line">one sentence per line</a>,
one phrase per line, or other specific formatting.
However, choosing which guideline to require, recommend, or even make optional,
is a potentially long and difficult process.
Instead of bogging down this JEP in that process,
we decided to consider asciidoc style and formatting guidelines in a later JEP.</p>

<p>There are currently no Asciidoc linters.
